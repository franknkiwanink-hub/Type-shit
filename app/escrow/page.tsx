      <StaticSection heading="What escrow means here">
        <p>
          When a buyer pays for a deal, the money moves into escrow — held by Siterifty, not the
          seller. It only reaches the seller&apos;s wallet once the buyer confirms delivery, or
          once the 72-hour verification window passes without a dispute. At no point can a seller
          pull funds out of an unconfirmed deal.
        </p>
      </StaticSection>

      <StaticSection heading="The wallet">
        <p>
          All payments on Siterifty run through your wallet, not directly card-to-card or
          account-to-account. You top up your wallet (via card or PayPal, from Settings → Payment
          Methods), and that balance is what funds deals and receives payouts. This keeps every
          transaction inside one consistent, logged system instead of scattering payment methods
          across individual deals.
        </p>
      </StaticSection>

      <StaticSection heading="Platform fees">
        <p>
          Siterifty takes a percentage of the sale price when a deal completes — never charged
          up front. The rate depends on the seller&apos;s plan at the time of sale:

      <StaticSection heading="Delivery & downloads">
        <p>
          Sellers deliver files, credentials, or transfer details directly inside the deal chat.
          Any files attached to a deal are only accessible to the buyer and seller on that
          specific deal — download links are short-lived and re-generated on request, not
          permanent public URLs.

      <StaticSection heading="If it goes wrong">
        <p>
          Either party can raise a dispute before funds release, which freezes the escrow
          immediately — no further action happens on that deal until our team reviews it, which
          we do within 24–48 hours.
