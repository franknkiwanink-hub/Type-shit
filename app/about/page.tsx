        <p>
          Most marketplaces for digital products are built for agencies and big studios. Siterifty
          is built for the developer shipping solo — the one who spent a few weekends on a
          side project, or built a small SaaS that didn&apos;t take off the way they hoped, and
          just wants a straightforward, fair place to sell it to someone who will.

      <StaticSection heading="What we do differently">
        <p>
          Every sale on Siterifty goes through escrow: a buyer&apos;s payment is held until they
          confirm they&apos;ve received what they paid for, so neither side has to trust a
          stranger with their money up front. Platform fees scale down as sellers grow — sellers
          on a free plan keep 70% of every sale, and that share climbs with paid plans, instead
          of everyone paying the same cut regardless of volume.

      <StaticSection heading="Who's behind it">
        <p>
          Siterifty is an independently built platform — one developer, one vision, written the
          same way most of the products sold here were: alone, nights and weekends, for other
          people doing the same thing. If you&apos;re an indie hacker looking for a place to sell
          what you&apos;ve built, this is who it&apos;s for.
