      <StaticSection heading="1. What Siterifty is">
        <p>
          Siterifty is a marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of websites, apps, games, and
          templates. Siterifty facilitates the transaction — including escrow — but is not a
          party to the underlying sale of the listed product itself.
        </p>
      </StaticSection>

      <StaticSection heading="2. Accounts">
        <p>
          You&apos;re responsible for the activity on your account and for keeping your login
          credentials secure. One person or business per account — accounts found to be shared or
          created to evade a restriction may be suspended.
        </p>
      </StaticSection>

      <StaticSection heading="3. Listings">
        <p>
          Sellers are responsible for the accuracy of what they list — description, financials,
          and what&apos;s actually included in the sale. Listing something you don&apos;t have the
          right to sell (stolen code, unlicensed assets, someone else&apos;s product) is grounds
          for removal and account suspension. Weekly listing limits apply based on your plan.
        </p>
      </StaticSection>

      <StaticSection heading="4. Payments, wallet & fees">
        <p>
          All payments flow through your Siterifty wallet. When a deal completes, Siterifty
          deducts a platform fee from the sale price before crediting the seller&apos;s wallet.
          The fee rate depends on the seller&apos;s plan at the time of sale (currently 30% on
          Free, 20% on Starter, 10% on Growth, 5% on Pro) and is disclosed before a deal is
          accepted.
        </p>
      </StaticSection>

      <StaticSection heading="5. Escrow & disputes">
        <p>
          Funds a buyer pays into a deal are held in escrow until the buyer confirms delivery or
          the verification window (72 hours after the seller marks a deal delivered) passes
          without a dispute. Either party may raise a dispute before funds release, which freezes
          the escrow pending review by Siterifty&apos;s team. Siterifty&apos;s decision on a
          dispute is final for the purposes of releasing escrowed funds.
        </p>
      </StaticSection>

      <StaticSection heading="6. Prohibited conduct">
        <p>
          Circumventing escrow (arranging payment outside the platform to avoid fees), harassment,
          fraud, and attempts to manipulate reviews, ratings, or the seller badge system are all
          grounds for suspension.
        </p>
      </StaticSection>

      <StaticSection heading="7. What data we collect">
        <p>
          Account data (email, username, avatar), listing and deal content, wallet transaction
          history, and basic usage data needed to operate the marketplace (session/device info for
          security, push notification subscriptions if you opt in). We don&apos;t sell your data
          to third parties.
        </p>
      </StaticSection>

      <StaticSection heading="8. Limitation of liability">
        <p>
          Siterifty facilitates transactions in good faith but doesn&apos;t guarantee the quality,
          legality, or performance of any listed product. Our liability for any claim is limited
          to the fees Siterifty actually collected on the deal in question.
        </p>
      </StaticSection>

      <StaticSection heading="9. Changes to these terms">
        <p>
          We may update these terms as the platform evolves. Material changes will be reflected
          here with an updated date; continued use of Siterifty after a change means you accept
          the updated terms.
