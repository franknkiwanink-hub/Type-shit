        <p>
          Funds stay in escrow until you confirm you received what was promised, or the 72-hour
          verification window passes. If a seller marks a deal delivered and you don&apos;t agree,
          you don&apos;t have to confirm — raise a dispute instead and the payment stays frozen.

      <StaticSection heading="Disputes are reviewed by a person">
        <p>
          Opening a dispute doesn&apos;t just cancel the deal automatically — it hands the case to
          our team, who reviews the deal chat, the listing, and both sides&apos; account history
          before deciding how funds are released. Reviews are typically completed within 24–48
          hours.
        </p>

      <StaticSection heading="Everything happens in one paper trail">
        <p>
          All deal communication and file delivery happens inside the deal chat, not over email
          or a third-party tool. That means if a dispute is raised, there&apos;s a complete record
          of what was agreed and what was actually delivered — nothing depends on a screenshot or
          a &quot;they told me&quot; claim.
        </p>

      <StaticSection heading="Reporting bad actors">
        <p>
          You can report a listing or a seller directly from their profile. Reports are reviewed
          by our team and aren&apos;t visible to the reported seller, so there&apos;s no risk of
          retaliation for flagging something that looks wrong.
        </p>
      </StaticSection>

      <StaticSection heading="What buyer protection doesn't cover">
        <p>
          Escrow protects the payment itself — it doesn&apos;t evaluate the quality of what
          you&apos;re buying ahead of time. Review a listing&apos;s description, financials, and
          seller history carefully before opening a deal, the same way you would with any other
          marketplace purchase.
